# Code Tank
## About
__Code Tank__ is a simple CLI program for Windows that allows users to run a code "fish tank" effect in any of their CLIs. It was designed to consume as few resources as possible so that you can do what you do best without any slowdowns.

Basically, it offers a lightweight effect in your console that can add to the immersion of your coding sessions. You can customize the effect to fit your needs and own personal taste.

## Features & Todo
Here are a list of features and options that we are currently working on:
* Run the program from the command line to generate the effect.
* Changes various aspects of the effect including:
* * Color of the effect (Text color of everything(df:white), error colors(df:red), success colors(df: green), pending color(df:yellow).)
* * Style of the effect (current ideas: Matrix Rain, Cyberpunk, Hacker, and Tony Stark OS)
* * Speed of the effect (How fast each line generates)
* * Optimal memory management for all users.
