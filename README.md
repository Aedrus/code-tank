## Introduction
__Code Tank__ is a simple program for Windows that allows users to run a code "fish tank" effect in any of their CLIs. It was designed to consume as few resources as possible and maintain a low profile.

__Code Tank__ was created with the goal of adding a little excitement to each of your coding sessions. It offers a few built-in styles that change the visual appearance of your tank and a range of customization options. Code Tank is open source, which means it is free to download, use, and distribute under the MIT license.

For more information on how to get started, customizing code tank, or adding your own style, head over to our [documentation]() page.

## Installing and Running Code Tank
### Requirements

## How to run a Code Tank
To get started, first run the application via the packaged .exe file.

### How to customize your Code Tank
To change a thing, run the following command:

```app create "thingy"```

From here you can append a variety of arugments to perform utility operations:

```app create "thingy" -remove```

```app create "thingy" -add```

```app create "thingy" -modify```

### Creating custom Styles
Styles alter the visual appearance of your tank based on criteria outlined in json files.This allows users to create unique and highly-tailored designs for their tank. 

To begin, create an empty json file on your drive. Ideally, you may want to give it a name that is related to the theme of your Style, i.e. matrix, cats, hackertext, etc.
